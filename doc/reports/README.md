# OneFLOW project reports

This directory stores maintained project reports and selected historical snapshots.
Plans, handoffs, runbooks, and validation evidence live in their dedicated sibling
directories under `doc/`; they do not belong here. Individual CI logs, Slurm records,
and environment dumps belong in CI artifacts or isolated cluster run directories.

## Naming convention

The authoritative repository-wide rule is [Document naming standard](../DOCUMENT_NAMING.md).
The following report-specific shorthand is kept here for convenience.

Use `oneflow-<topic>-<document-type>[-YYYYMMDD].<ext>`:

- use a stable name such as `current` for actively maintained reports;
- keep the date for historical snapshots and point-in-time evidence;
- keep Markdown as the source of truth when a matching HTML report exists.

The residual baseline definitions remain under `test/baselines/`; they are test inputs,
not project reports. Raw CI/Slurm logs, environment dumps, temporary run directories,
credentials, and unredacted private cluster metadata remain outside the public repository.
