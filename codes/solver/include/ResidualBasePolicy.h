// One decision shared by the two places that must agree about the explicit
// Runge-Kutta bookkeeping:
//   * FieldTaskReg decides whether LOAD_Q / LOAD_RESIDUALS still fill the
//     host FIELD_FLOW / FIELD_RHS slots;
//   * UNsInvFlux decides whether the device residual starts from the uploaded
//     host field or from zero on the device.
// If only one of them changes, the stage silently accumulates on the previous
// stage's residual.  That is a numerical regression, not a performance knob.
//
// The device owns this bookkeeping only for the validated explicit chain:
// steady multi-stage, finest grid, single grid level, NS solver, inviscid,
// no chemistry, no dual time.  Everything else keeps the host slots
// authoritative (multigrid restriction reads FIELD_FLOW, the host update and
// the multigrid defect read FIELD_RHS).
//
// Implementation: codes/solver/src/ResidualBasePolicy.cpp.
